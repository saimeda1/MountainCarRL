# Q-Learning with MountainCar-v0

This project demonstrates the implementation of Q-Learning for the MountainCar-v0 environment using the Gymnasium library.

## Overview

MountainCar-v0 is a classic control problem where an underpowered car must drive up a steep mountain. The goal is to reach the flag at the top right of the mountain. However, the car's engine is not strong enough to simply drive up the mountain in a single pass. The car must build up momentum by driving back and forth.

This implementation uses Q-Learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, to train the agent to solve the MountainCar-v0 environment.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- gymnasium
- matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:
